<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Welcome! My name is George, and I’m an aspiring web developer with a passion
  for creativity, problem-solving, and continuous learning. As someone who loves
  uncovering how things work and why they work, web development quickly became
  the perfect space for me to explore and grow. Outside of coding, I’m a
  dedicated FC Barcelona fan, a lifelong admirer of Lionel Messi, and someone
  who finds joy in video games, travel, hiking, and horror movies. I also enjoy
  helping others whenever I can — collaboration and support are values I carry
  both in and outside the tech world. As I continue building my skills and
  portfolio, I’m excited to take on new challenges, learn from every
  opportunity, and contribute to meaningful digital experiences. Thanks for
  visiting my site!
